## Description

#### 3/12 Work from Home Summary
- Music Organizer
  - practice in objects within objects
- Upper Cohort Trade Show
- Hangman
  - Not finished at 5pm, currently works due to being finished later
- Struggles: Finishing hangman on time, dynamic picture source links, figuring out how to get data types to compare and display properly

This application practices MVC and objects within objects in a game of hangman where the user guesses letters and the answer is from a hardcoded list.  The user can't guess the same item htt was already guessed or items that haven't healed.  The picture of a hangman dynamically changes as the user guesses wrongly.
